This details the object file format for the atoc simulator.
Files should end in '.ao' for convention.
Must begin with the magic number 0x61 or 'a'.

The file is simply repeated blocks of data to be stored in memory. Each block begins with a byte indicating which address to start, and a byte indicating how many bytes follow. Bytes passing the end of the address space is undefined, this simulator with simply quit.

Not all data will be written, especially to memory mapped IO and RAM. However this is up to the implementation. The atoc simulator reserves addresses 0x00-0x3f for memory mapped items and 0x40-0x7f for RAM.
